### About me
•I'm a fan of artiulated low entry intercity spurbuses, like the Scan... Citywide, Volv... 8500LEA, Credo... Econell Next. also like TramTrains, esp the Stadl...ones. while i like most european bus and railway brands, i heavily dislike non-eu brands, such as CR..C, Yut..ng... i'm mostly into diesel power, or non-battery electric, bc batteries are dangerous.  
•My profession is welder, i learned tungsten, stick, CO2 and flame welding, but i work with a robot by now and it looks like im gonna work with it for a long time...  
•i like those old experimental and feauture phones, like slide-out keyboards and rotate-out cameras, my current phone, the Armor 15 has built in earbuds, so i kind of ended up keeping this interest lol  
•so, (best way to start a sentence xd(am too old to use slangs like 'xd' what i am doing lol) my music taste consists of:  
- melodic and raw extratone-ultratone
- heavy dubstep, metalstep, filthstep, the like
- rawstyle, gym hardstyle

•My english is bad because i am from Ungarn and i never learned English outside school, so i am far from good in it  
•Cannot tell why specifically but i like crossfoxes overall, ex. their look, their behaviour, their nonhumanness (as i dislike the homo sapiens as a species) like they dont have to pay taxes etc, like would be nice to exist around and dont give a sht about anything in the world...
